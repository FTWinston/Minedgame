    "help1-2-1a": "This is an obscured cell. Most cells start like this: You don't yet know if it contains a bomb, or a clue.",
    "help1-2-1b": "Tap or left click on an obscured cell to reveal its content. If it contains a clue, this will show. If it contains a bomb, you lose!",

    "help1-2-2b": "Long press or right click on an obscured cell to flag it as a bomb. If it doesn't contain a bomb, this counts as an error.",
    "help1-2-3a": "This is a clue. (This one indicates that 3 of its adjacent cells contain bombs.)",
    "help1-2-3b": "The number of un-flagged bombs is shown in the bottom left of the screen. You win when this number reaches zero.",

    "help2-2-1": "A <strong>basic clue</strong> shows the number of bombs in adjacent cells.",
    "help2-2-2": "A <strong>contiguous clue</strong> is shown between curly brackets: this indicates that associated bombs are adjacent to each other.",
    "help2-2-3": "A <strong>split clue</strong> is shown between dashes: this indicates that associated bombs are not all adjacent to each other.",
    "help2-3": "A clue will fade to grey when all of its associated cells have been revealed or flagged.",
    "help3-1": "Other types of clue relate to different cells, but they behave in a similar manner.",
    "help3-2-1": "A number not contained in a cell is a <strong>row clue</strong>. This shows the number of bombs along a line. The number is rotated to indicate the line's direction, and the line always continues to the edge of the board, even when there are gaps between cells.<br/> (The line is always \"down\" from the angle of the number.)",
    "help3-2-2": "A number in a blue cell is an <strong>area clue</strong>. This shows the number of bombs within a two-cell radius.",
    "help3-3": "Sometimes it isn't obvious which cells are associated with a clue. Tap or click on any clue to highlight its associated cells."
